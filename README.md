**NOTES**

* We care about style, simplicity and good conventions.
* Use what the language/framework provides, i.e. don't write raw SQL when you have AR/AREL nor
  should you re-write getter/setter methods when you have attr_accessors.
* Follow this style guide for Ruby: https://github.com/styleguide/ruby.
* If you get stuck or have clarification questions, ask us right away. Bruno and Jey will be
  available all day to answer questions.

The instructions above are somewhat vague and that's OK, we expect you to make some assumptions.
